# WildGuard: An animal detection system ðŸŽ¯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Pixelle


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Hiba Beeran - Toc H institute of science and technology
- Member 2: Aiswarya Saju - Toc H institute of science and technology


### Project Description
An AI based animal detection system which detects wild animals using YOLO and sends notification to the user once the wild animal is detected using twilio. The project can be further developed with the help of hardwares like raspberry pi or jetson nano to make a repellent system using tone generators

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In our daily lives we come to hear a lot of news regarding wild animal attacks on our livelihood, agriculture as well as residential areas. Most of the people are not able to get notified about the presence of wild animals around them and leads to huge loses. Once they are notified they could take up the appropriate measures to eliminate the problem of having a wild animal next to their place by implementing humane solutions like generating different frequency tones which disturbs the animal and are much better than the traditional methods of using electric shock fence as well as cracking crackers to repel them .

### The Solution 
--detecting animal using YOLO from a surveillance camera and sending notification to the user interfacing with twilio 
--once a person witnesses the presence of a wild animal they could use our website to send the location of the place where they saw the animal after that the authorities are notified about it and appropriate measures are taken 
--can be further modified using hardwares, to generate tones to repel the wild animals
